# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

We will be building a nutrition-based application that allows our users to track all the macronutrients they have eaten during the day. We plan on having different tabs with different food categories (i.e. dairy, fibers, meat, etc.) in order to make it easily readable and usable for all users. This app is designed for anyone trying to track their food intake, from bodybuilders to businessmen. It is our intention that with a single press of a button, the food will be added to your intake for the day tab which will be accessible through the main menu. 

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

## Constraints
Amaury Couturier

One constraint we may have is the timeline seeing as there are thousands of food items, we will not have time to implement every single one but we are hoping to get the most common/basic ones so that we have effective and useable software.

Jake Pinos

One constraint we migh have is with merging all of our branches and making them work together. Also meshing together all of the Requiments we are tyring to implement but we should be able to do it.

Tyler Dunphy

Another possible constraint is making sure the flow of information is consistent across the project. Collaboration is critical to make sure we are all using whatever databases we create in the right way to output functional software.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

Amaury Couturier

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

Amaury Couturier
- US-1
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** (From the perspective of a customer of a personal trainer) I need to check that I hit the correct amount of macronutrients today. I need to hit 2200 calories, 150 grams of protein, 250 grams of carbohydrates, and 75 grams of fat. For breakfast today, I had two eggs and a piece of toast. For lunch, I had an 8-ounce steak with steamed broccoli. I will input all of that into my application to see what my macronutrients are looking like for now. I am at a total of 875 calories, 18.2 grams of carbohydrates, 54.3 grams of fat, and 73.6 grams of protein. I now know that I need a high amount of carbohydrates and calories in my next two meals in order to stay on track with my training routine. 

- US-2
  - **Type of User:** Patient
  - **Description:** (Doctor seeing a patient). What may I help you with today? I recently went to go donate blood and it turns out my cholesterol levels are unusually high. Alright, let’s get this figured out. Can you start off by telling me what a typical day of eating looks like for you? *patient lists off diet*. As you can see you are intaking around 300 grams of fat per day. Despite fats being very beneficial for the body, if the intake of saturated fats is not done in moderation, the cholesterol levels in your blood will rise leading to an increase in the risk of heart disease and stroke. Create an account with this application and track your food intake daily, you should be aiming for around 175 grams of fat per day. We will do a checkup in around a month.

Jake Pinos
- US-1
  - **Type of User:** Customer(vegan)
  - **Description:** (From the perspective of a customer) This user is a vegan looking for food that fit their lifestyle and needs. They recently went to look for stores that fit their needs and are moraly doing the right thing. So they would be able to use the categories to see the food they want and catered to them. 

  - US-1
  - **Type of User:** UFC Fighter(wanting to loose wheight)
  - **Description:** As a UFC fighter before fights they need to make weigh in so he could fight. So going to this website they will be able to use the nutrientional facts to see if this will help them meet their goals. 

Amaury Couturier
- US-1
  - **Type of User:** Customer (hypoglycemia)
  - **Description:** (From customer). I've been having trouble with my blood sugar levels lately, as I have hypoglycemia. I have been finding little ways to improve my health. I found this application, and put a note that blood sugar was on average lower than the average person, and the app got me started on diet tracking. The app told me to eat more whole grains, so I stopped buying white bread and switched to the whole grain. It also recommended good fats like avocado, so I started making avocato toast on whole wheat for breakfast. I also was putting in the sodas I was drinking, and I got a suggestion to cut down or make a substitution to diet drinks. After making these changes, my levels are generally higher than they used to be and I feel like I have more energy. 

- US-2
  - **Type of User:** Customer (underweight)
  - **Description:** (From customer). I have been underweight for a long time now, as I tend to not eat enough because of my night shifts. I've been wanting to gain back more weight, so I started using this app I found for diet tracking. The first thing it told me is that I was below my ideal calorie count, and it recommended I start eating foods like granola bars and nuts like cashews because of their high calorie count. I started bringing trail mix to work, and I made sure to put nutrition bars in my car for on the way and after work. It also reminded me that multiple meals throughought the day are important, and I started making sure to do that more often. Even though I'm still under my calorie count, it's much closer and I feel better overall nowadays.
