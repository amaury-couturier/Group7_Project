# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

We will be building a nutrition-based application that allows our users to track all the macronutrients they have eaten during the day. We plan on having different tabs with different food categories (i.e. dairy, fibers, meat, etc.) in order to make it easily readable and usable for all users. This app is designed for anyone trying to track their food intake, from bodybuilders to businessmen. It is our intention that with a single press of a button, the food will be added to your intake for the day tab which will be accessible through the main menu. 

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- REQ-1
  - **Description:** A dictionary containing the calories of all the foods that are included in the software.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** This will display the calories under all food items for our users to see, which is the main “component” of weight loss/weight gain. 
  - **Testing:** See if the correct amount of calories is displayed under each individual food item.

- REQ-2
  - **Description:** A dictionary containing the protein of all the foods that are included in the software.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** This will display the protein under all food items for our users to see, which plays a major part in muscle building.
  - **Testing:** See if the correct amount of protein is displayed under each individual food item.

- REQ-3
  - **Description:** A dictionary containing the carbohydrates of all the foods that are included in the software.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** This will display the carbohydrates under all food items for our users to see, which plays a major part in energy levels throughout one’s day.
  - **Testing:** See if the correct amount of carbohydrates is displayed under each individual food item.

## Constraints

-One constraint we may have is the timeline seeing as there are thousands of food items, we will not have time to implement every single one but we are hoping to get the most common/basic ones so that we have effective and useable software.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- UC-1
  - **Description:** This app could be used for personal training. When it comes to training, whether that be weight training or training with only body weight, a very important aspect to get into better shape and healthier is nutrition. This app could allow the customer to be set on a personal diet by their personal trainer.
  - **Actors:** The customer and the personal trainer.
  - **Preconditions:** The personal trainer must have access to a phone or computer. The customer must have an account where they can save the diet given by the personal trainer. The personal trainer must make the diet in the customer’s account, not their own.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer must remember their login information in order to view the diet.

- UC-2
  - **Description:** A doctor could use this app to see all the macros that their patient has been intaking. The patient could also use this to track their macronutrients post-office visit. 
  - **Actors:** The doctor and their patient
  - **Preconditions:** The doctor must have access to a phone or computer. If the doctor would like to save this diet for future visits, they need to have an account. 
  - **Postconditions:** If told by the doctor, the patient must keep using this app (while logged into their account) to keep track of their diet.

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- US-1
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** (From the perspective of a customer of a personal trainer) I need to check that I hit the correct amount of macronutrients today. I need to hit 2200 calories, 150 grams of protein, 250 grams of carbohydrates, and 75 grams of fat. For breakfast today, I had two eggs and a piece of toast. For lunch, I had an 8-ounce steak with steamed broccoli. I will input all of that into my application to see what my macronutrients are looking like for now. I am at a total of 875 calories, 18.2 grams of carbohydrates, 54.3 grams of fat, and 73.6 grams of protein. I now know that I need a high amount of carbohydrates and calories in my next two meals in order to stay on track with my training routine. 

- US-2
  - **Type of User:** Patient
  - **Description:** (Doctor seeing a patient). What may I help you with today? I recently went to go donate blood and it turns out my cholesterol levels are unusually high. Alright, let’s get this figured out. Can you start off by telling me what a typical day of eating looks like for you? *patient lists off diet*. As you can see you are intaking around 300 grams of fat per day. Despite fats being very beneficial for the body, if the intake of saturated fats is not done in moderation, the cholesterol levels in your blood will rise leading to an increase in the risk of heart disease and stroke. Create an account with this application and track your food intake daily, you should be aiming for around 175 grams of fat per day. We will do a checkup in around a month.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- **Term:** Macronutrients
  - **Definition:** “Macronutrients are the nutrients we need in larger quantities that provide us with energy: in other words, fat, protein, and carbohydrate” (British Heart Foundation).

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
  - The URL to your group's GitHub repository, with the latest version of your code pushed to the `main` branch.
